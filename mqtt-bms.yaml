#The bms-to-inverter project does not support Home Assistant MQTT discovery.  Configuration must be done manually in config.yaml.
#Copy this file to Home Assistant config folder
#Modify configuration.yaml file in that folder, adding this line (remove the #):
#
#mqtt: !include mqtt-bms.yaml
#
#Note that if you already have MQTT entries in you configuration.yaml, you may need to modify the include approach.
#
#You can modify the below configuration as needed, adding or removing entities as required.  If you add, make sure that the device info is identical.  
#All entities are grouped under the device name, based on these identical entries
#To add, you can peruse the JSON file which captures the incoming data from bms-to-inverter.  The JSON structure is independent of the BMS you are using.  
#The example is from a typical #Chinese battery using the Pylon-CAN BMS, and is rather sparse in the data it produces. 
#Note that here all of the numeric values are in tenths and so must be divided by 10 in the value template.
